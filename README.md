# Eunoia-Mental-Health-Awareness-in-Workplace-Environment

## Introduction

With an increase in technology, social network, and efficiency, human beings have been forced to become more efficient than ever. And with exceedingly intensive expections comes feelings of social resentment, depression, and lack of vigour. Mental illness in the workplace environment is still something that is known but not quite acted upon on a global scale, and hence is a universally-erupting meltdown. 

## Brief description of this project

This project uses Artificial Intelligence to act upon a 2014 Mental Health Survey in order to produce results regarding detection and requirement of treatment. I compare efficiency rates among:
- Logistic Regression, 
- K Neighbours Classifier, and 
- Tree Classifier

To obtain the best method and store the computed results to a CSV file. I have been able to achieve a success rate of 81% (based on the dataset alone).
